## Hi there 👋
~~I am plugin/mod developer mainly for minecraft.~~  
No, I am doing practice for my enjoyable programming!  
Always every time, interesting about programming, and running it right away.  
This is what I'm good at.  

## I don't use VSCode
I have been using Neovim for a while.  
You know, it's called Vimmer!!
Are you insterested in Vim?
If you do like so, it would be pleasure to see my [Neovim-Setting-Repo](https://github.com/bella2391/my-nvim.git).  
I'm glowing up with Neovim, which is for only myself.

In my view, the best lang i can use is `Java`, to the next `js`/`ts`, `PHP`.
